# Heroes-Survive-Added-actions-Crafting-etc...

This project could not of been possible without Slay no more, he helped me a lot with the code configuration and the first template that jumpstarted this project.

This is a collection of scripts that I have been working on, for implementation of crafting towards any HS scenario it also adds a ton of other features HS doesn't have, boiling water, collecting water from wells, etc...

This is no longer being worked on, feel free to change, edit, rework any of this.

In order to use this you will need some slight SQF knowledge to add it into a scenario, the only requirement is ofcourse the Heros Survive Mod. Some of the craft-able items you will need to change around via added items to inventory, etc... As this DOES utilize CUP as well for some classnames...
