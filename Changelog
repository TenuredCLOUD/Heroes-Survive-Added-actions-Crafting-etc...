Version 0.2 8/21/21:

Found lots of bugs & exploits, they should now be patched in this version

-Fixed being able to spam add-actions for crafting, and some other functions... (Variable locking /Removal of action once activated)

-Added small IED crafting (same as large IED craft, just requires car battery)

-Added redundant hint while adding a battery to electronics, this should help with the "freezing" error in MP
