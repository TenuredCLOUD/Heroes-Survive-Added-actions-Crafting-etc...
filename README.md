# Heroes-Survive-Added-actions-Crafting-etc...

This project could not of been possible without Slay no more, he helped me a lot with the code configuration and the first template that jumpstarted this project.

This is a collection of scripts that I have been working on, for implementation of crafting towards any HS scenario it also adds a ton of other features HS doesn't have, boiling water, collecting water from wells, etc...

This is version 0.1 and will be continually updated until I am done with it.

In order to use this you will need some slight SQF knowledge to add it into a scenario, the only requirement is ofcourse the Heros Survive Mod.
