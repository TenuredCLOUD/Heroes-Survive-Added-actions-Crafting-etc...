# Heroes-Survive-Added-actions-Crafting-etc...

This project could not of been possible without Slay no more, he helped me a lot with the code configuration and the first template that jumpstarted this project.

This is a collection of scripts that I have been working on, for implementation of crafting towards any HS scenario it also adds a ton of other features HS doesn't have, boiling water, collecting water from wells, etc...

This is version 0.1 and will be continually updated until I am done with it. Please keep in mind this is still WIP and some code has some redundancies / mistakes or can even be executed better. If you have any input on any of the code feel free to reach out to me on my Discord.

In order to use this you will need some slight SQF knowledge to add it into a scenario, the only requirement is ofcourse the Heros Survive Mod. Some of the craft-able items you will need to change around via added items to inventory, etc... As this DOES utilize CUP as well for some classnames...
